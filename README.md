# Chicago_Crime_Risk_Model
A PySpark-based machine learning pipeline to classify violent and non-violent crimes in Chicago using the official crime dataset. Includes full ETL, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and visual evaluation.

# Chicago Crime Risk Model 🚔📊

This project builds a scalable machine learning pipeline using PySpark to classify violent vs non-violent crimes reported in Chicago since 2001. It includes end-to-end data engineering, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, ensemble voting, evaluation, and optimization.

## 📌 Project Summary

We analyze 300K+ historical records from the Chicago Police Department to uncover spatial, temporal, and behavioral patterns in crime. Our objective is to build a risk model to support data-driven decision-making for policy makers and law enforcement.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Gradient Boosted Tree classifier with 76% accuracy
- Ensemble model improves violent crime precision to 79%
- Identifies theft-heavy and vice-heavy hotspots for focused intervention
- Reveals spatial clustering of violent crimes

## 🧪 ML Model Pipeline

- Cleaned and indexed critical fields
- Engineered new features: hour, weekday, year, etc.
- Binary classification:
  - `1`: Violent crime (e.g., homicide, robbery, assault)
  - `0`: Non-violent crime
- Models:
  - **Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT)** - Base model
  - **Voting Ensemble (LR + RF + XGBoost)** - Final model
- Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision-Recall Curve
  - Class-wise F1 scores
